# Sonar Battle (Unity)

Game idea inspired by 300 Mechanics: http://www.squidi.net/three/entry.php?id=85

## Theme

Two rockets are stuck in a cave and must duel to determine who survives... but there's a catch: the ships can only see one another using sonar!

## Mechanics

Base ideas:
* Your ship flies towards your mouse. 
* Keyboard for firing weapons and sonar pings.
* Shields can be activated or deactivated, but you become easier to detect.
* Sonar pings can be fired to find the other ship(s).

## Platforms

Developed in Unity, therefore targeting Desktop, WebGL, and possibly Android.
